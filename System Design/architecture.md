#### Layers VS Tiers
LOL! All this while, I thought layers and tiers meant thesame thing! Not actually. Layers refer to the logical organization of your code into components (User interface, Business logic, Data) while 
Tiers refer to the physical separation of your application components accross different computers e.g Client, Database server, API, Messaging System, Caching system
